#### Lost and found itens website
This project is a website developed in C# for lost and found itens around campus. It was developed using Visual Studio as IDE and MySQL as database and followed the MVC architecture. It also has an integrated chat between users implemented with signalR.

Also, this was the final project of web development 2 discipline in my computer engineering major.
